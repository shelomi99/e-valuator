# E-valuator - Automated Evaluation of Descriptive Answers

The main goal of this project is to evaluate essay questions based on a predefined answer script.
The procedure takes a semantic approach, identifying semantic relationships between the two responses and assigning a similarity score to the provided answer. 
The similarity score is divided into fuzzy keyword similarity, string similarity, and knowledge graph similarity score. 
The final score will be calculated by combining these three scores.
